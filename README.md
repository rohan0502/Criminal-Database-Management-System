#Criminal Database Management System
This project, titled "CRIMINAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM," was developed by Rohan Sharma, a dedicated software developer with expertise in C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, OOPs, DBMS, and SQL.

#Introduction
In any society, laws are established to maintain order, and when these laws are violated, individuals become criminals. The Criminal Database Management System provides a structured approach to managing records of criminals and their activities, aiding law enforcement in tracking and administering justice effectively.

#Need for a Management System
A well-organized law enforcement system is essential for maintaining peace and order within a society. The transition from manual to computerized records has significantly improved the efficiency and accessibility of data management, ensuring that crucial information remains intact and readily available.

#Construction of the System
The system utilizes algorithms such as binary search for efficient data retrieval and management. It comprises functionalities for administrators, sub-administrators, police personnel, and the court system, allowing for seamless collaboration and information sharing among stakeholders.

#Uses of a Criminal Management System
Record-keeping of criminals for future investigations
Monitoring of criminal activities
Reduction of manual effort through organized records
Facilitation of information sharing among personnel
Provision of secure data storage
#Working of the System
The system offers features such as adding, modifying, and deleting records, along with search and display functionalities. It employs various header files for file handling, string operations, and user interface enhancements. Class-based implementation enhances flexibility and maintainability.

#Conclusion
Implemented by Rohan Sharma in C++, the project underscores the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) and file handling. By leveraging these concepts, the system demonstrates improved flexibility and maintainability, offering a comprehensive solution for managing criminal records effectively.
